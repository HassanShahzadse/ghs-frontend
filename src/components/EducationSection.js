        Eton is at the vanguard of innovation in education, leading powerful
        research and cross-sector collaborations to develop expertise in

      <p>
        An Eton education produces the best outcomes for our boys, developing
        enquiring minds and fostering a lifelong appreciation of independent
        thinking and learning. Our approach to the classroom draws on the most
        effective methods evidenced by our award-winning research centre, The
        Tony Little Centre for Innovation and Research in Learning (CIRL).
