        We are proud of the broad range of careers Etonians go into, building on
        passions nurtured during their time at Eton.
      </h3>
      <p>
        Moving through our co-curriculum has led our boys to set the standard on
        the world stage, whether in sport, the Arts, entrepreneurship, the
        natural world or wherever else their passions lie.
      </p>
      <p>
        We give boys a clear understanding of the world of work and the broad
        range of career routes to pursue, whether through Oxbridge or elsewhere.
        Eton Futures, our department dedicated to their lives after Eton, weaves
        employability into the Eton curriculum.
      </p>
      <p>
        The thriving Old Etonian Association is a fantastic network and resource,
        with societies and clubs providing support all around the world in a wide
        range of fields.
