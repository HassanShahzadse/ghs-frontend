                    Boys that require further intervention can also either be
                    assessed on-site by one of our specialist teachers or they
                    can be referred to one of our highly respected, outside
                    agency professionals.&nbsp; The department also oversees and
                    monitors all access arrangements for internal and public
                    examinations, and works closely with the Deputy Head
                    (Academic) and the Exams Officer.&nbsp; All access
                    arrangements put into place stringently follow the JCQ and
                    CIE guidelines.

                      Pupils with SEND also make excellent progress in line with

                    The department comprises a Head of Learning Support (the
                    Special Educational Needs Coordinator), a Deputy Head of
                    Learning Support, two full-time learning support teachers
                    and two part-time learning support teachers.&nbsp; All staff
                    within the department have undergone a range of degrees and
                    specialist qualifications relating to Special Educational
                    Needs and Disabilities. The department continues to study
                    and develop with regards to SEND, just as the boys do that
                    we teach.

                    Communication with parents and carers is also vital to the
                    development of a boy&#8217;s learning profile and the
                    department welcomes the input.&nbsp; Even before a boy joins
                    GHS, such communication is urged so we can ensure the
                    appropriate support is in place from the first day they move
                    in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
