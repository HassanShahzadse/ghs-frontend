                    Our aim is for boys to develop the skills and strategies
                    necessary to become successful, lifelong, independent and
                    confident learners.

                    Through specialist and bespoke intervention, boys gain a
                    clear understanding of their particular needs and develop
                    strategies to overcome their specific learning difficulties,
                    gain confidence in their own learning, fulfil academic
                    potential and acquire study skills that will equip them for
                    life at university and beyond. Guided by the learning
                    support department, Eton takes a whole school approach to
                    identifying and supporting boys with Special Educational
                    Needs and Disabilities (SEND), English as an Additional
                    Language (EAL) and those seeking advice or support to
                    further their studies.&nbsp;

                      it to be really helpful, as I could see the impacts it was
                      having on my academic achievements.

                    Support comes in many bespoke forms and is in place to help
                    boys confidently overcome current and future potential
                    challenges. Boys may receive one-to-one lessons focusing on
                    areas such as executive functioning skills, revision and
                    learning strategies, and handwriting development which will
                    enable them to work successfully across subject
                    areas.&nbsp;Group lessons are also provided focusing on
                    areas such as study skills, exam techniques and effective
                    reading strategies. The department also provides training,
                    support and information to the wider staff body with regards
                    to how they can differentiate and develop the educational
                    experiences of the boys they work with or teach.

                    specialist qualifications relating to Special Educational

                    Communication with parents and carers is also vital to the
                    development of a boy&#8217;s learning profile and the
                    department welcomes the input.&nbsp; Even before a boy joins
                    Eton, such communication is urged so we can ensure the
                    appropriate support is in place from the first day they move
                    in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
