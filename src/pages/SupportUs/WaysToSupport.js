                (Academic) and the Exams Officer.&nbsp; All access

                Special Educational Needs Coordinator), a Deputy Head of
                Learning Support, two full-time learning support teachers
                and two part-time learning support teachers.&nbsp; All staff
                within the department have undergone a range of degrees and
                specialist qualifications relating to Special Educational
                Needs and Disabilities. The department continues to study
                and develop with regards to SEND, just as the boys do that
                we teach.

                Communication with parents and carers is also vital to the
                development of a boy&#8217;s learning profile and the
                department welcomes the input.&nbsp; Even before a boy joins
                GHS , such communication is urged so we can ensure the
                appropriate support is in place from the first day they move
                in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
