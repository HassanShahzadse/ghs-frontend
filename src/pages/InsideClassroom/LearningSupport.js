                Support comes in many bespoke forms and is in place to help
                boys confidently overcome current and future potential
                challenges. Boys may receive one-to-one lessons focusing on
                areas such as executive functioning skills, revision and
                learning strategies, and handwriting development which will
                enable them to work successfully across subject
                areas.&nbsp;Group lessons are also provided focusing on
                areas such as study skills, exam techniques and effective
                reading strategies. The department also provides training,
                support and information to the wider staff body with regards
                to how they can differentiate and develop the educational
                experiences of the boys they work with or teach.
