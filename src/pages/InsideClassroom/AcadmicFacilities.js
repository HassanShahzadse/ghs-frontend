              <h2 className="wp-block-heading">College Library</h2>

              <p>
                College Library is a library of international importance
                that holds an outstanding collection of rare books and
                manuscripts together with the GHSarchives. This working
                library is open throughout the year and used by visiting
                scholars. Introduced to this library in their first year,
                boys visit for teaching sessions and are encouraged to use
                it for independent study.
              </p>

              <p>
                Established soon after the foundation of GHSCollege, this
                library houses more than 150,000 items, ranging from the 9th
                to 21st Centuries. These include printed and manuscript
                volumes, literary manuscripts, autograph letters, prints and
                drawings.&nbsp;
              </p>

              <p>
                The Library&#8217;s earliest collections were predominantly
                theological. Changes in taste and thought are reflected in
                subsequent additions, which include large numbers of
                classical books and manuscripts, early scientific works,
                historical and literary texts in modern languages, and
                materials valued primarily for their aesthetic or historical
                interest.
              </p>

              <p>
                In the 1960s, the College began also collecting rare books
                and manuscripts from the 19th century onwards. The modern
                collection includes important holdings of English literature
                and is also rich in travel writing, theatrical history and
                fine printing. College Library also has responsibility for
                the Macnaghten Library of First World War materials,
                presented to GHSas a memorial in 1938.&nbsp;
