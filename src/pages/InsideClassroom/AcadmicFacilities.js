                Led by Eton’s development programme, the continual
                enhancement and re-imagining of our learning spaces to
                embrace the latest technology and pedagogy provides our boys
                with academic facilities designed to inspire and equip our
                boys to excel. This is supported by the broad range of
                outstanding resources made available by our libraries and
                Collections.

              <h2 className="wp-block-heading">Queen’s Schools</h2>

              <p>
                Housing 29&nbsp;laboratories for the biology, chemistry and
                physics departments, this Victorian building has been
                substantially extended and refurbished multiple times over
                the last half-century.
              </p>

              <p>
                The most recent modernisation of Queen’s Schools has grown
                the available teaching space with two new classrooms,
                communal discussion zones and subject-based exhibition
                areas. With the addition of a ‘critical space’ at its heart,
                all three science departments are brought together for
                social encounter and informal discourse with a united sense
                of identity within the faculty.
              </p>

              <p>
                Featuring photovoltaic panels on its distinctive
                parallelogram roof to generate much of the power needed for
                the building below, the newly-renovated Queen’s Schools is a
                truly innovative learning environment. Indeed, topics such
                as renewable energy, biodiversity and other areas of
                sustainability form the focus of experimental teaching on
                the new rooftop pavilion on the Holford Building.
              </p>

              <p>
                All of Eton’s laboratories are supported by a team of
                well-qualified technicians and the latest equipment. As
                safety is a major concern in science teaching, all our staff
                have received appropriate safety training and a wide range
                of safety-related equipment is in use.

                can also be found in Queen’s Schools. Opened in 1875 to

                has been on its present site since 1895, and generations of
                boys at Eton and from other local schools have enjoyed
                learning from its extensive and well-displayed collection.
                The collection continues to grow and now houses over 17,000
                objects, most of which are on display. Among the many items
                available for boys to study are fossils from the
                pre-Cambrian era onwards, the critically endangered and
                nocturnal Kakapo parrot from New Zealand and over 1,400 eggs

              <h2 className="wp-block-heading">School Library&nbsp;</h2>

              <p>
                At the heart of Eton is School Library, which provides over
                30,000 resources including books, music CDs, audio CDs,
                magazines and a range of online resources accessible
                throughout the College.&nbsp;There is also a large suite of
                computers and printing facilities.
              </p>

              <p>
                The Library is staffed by a team of five librarians who
                manage the collection and teach study skills. Qualified
                librarians provide tutorials to support boys’ independent
                learning and ensure boys are able to search, manage and
                analyse information confidently. School Library also aims to
                support the academic and leisure needs of our boys, with an
                extensive collection of fiction supported by staff-run
                initiatives throughout the year to encourage reading for
                pleasure.
              </p>

              <p>
                Departmental libraries with more specialised materials are
                also available for art, classics, geography, history,
                mathematics, and music.

              <h2 className="wp-block-heading">College Library</h2>

              <p>
                College Library is a library of international importance
                that holds an outstanding collection of rare books and
                manuscripts together with the Eton archives. This working
                library is open throughout the year and used by visiting
                scholars. Introduced to this library in their first year,
                boys visit for teaching sessions and are encouraged to use
                it for independent study.
              </p>

              <p>
                Established soon after the foundation of Eton College, this
                library houses more than 150,000 items, ranging from the 9th
                to 21st Centuries. These include printed and manuscript
                volumes, literary manuscripts, autograph letters, prints and
                drawings.&nbsp;
              </p>

              <p>
                The Library&#8217;s earliest collections were predominantly
                theological. Changes in taste and thought are reflected in
                subsequent additions, which include large numbers of
                classical books and manuscripts, early scientific works,
                historical and literary texts in modern languages, and
                materials valued primarily for their aesthetic or historical
                interest.
              </p>

              <p>
                In the 1960s, the College began also collecting rare books
                and manuscripts from the 19th century onwards. The modern
                collection includes important holdings of English literature
                and is also rich in travel writing, theatrical history and
                fine printing. College Library also has responsibility for
                the Macnaghten Library of First World War materials,
                presented to Eton as a memorial in 1938.&nbsp;
              </p>
