              Assessment plays a critical role in shaping a student’s learning journey, and at Global Hub School Karachi, we have developed a comprehensive examination system that reflects this philosophy. Year-round evaluations are designed to not only test a student’s understanding but also encourage consistent effort and continuous learning.
              </p>

              <p>
              As students advance through their academic years, the level of rigor increases, preparing them thoroughly for their final board examinations. These carefully curated assessments ensure that students are both challenged and supported, building their confidence and competence as they progress.

                <p>
                The system is designed to strike a balance between teaching and testing, creating an environment where students can master concepts while learning to handle the pressures of exams. By the time they graduate, our students are equipped not only with knowledge but also with the resilience and skills to excel in competitive academic environments.
