                Our academic curriculum is broad. With 28 subjects on offer,

                Our Masters are subject-specialists who invariably hold
                prestigious degrees in their subjects, but equally as
                important in their appointment has been their capacity to
                build relationships and inspire learners.

              <p style={{ fontFamily: 'Nunito Sans'}}>
                Our House Master and Tutor system ensures that at least two
