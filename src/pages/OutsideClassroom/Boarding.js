                Our academic curriculum is broad. With 28 subjects on offer,
                including 10 modern and classical languages, every boy has
                the best opportunity to discover his passion.&nbsp;

                Our Masters are subject-specialists who invariably hold
                prestigious degrees in their subjects, but equally as
                important in their appointment has been their capacity to
                build relationships and inspire learners.

              <p style={{ fontFamily: "'Nunito Sans', sans-serif" }}>
                Our House Master and Tutor system ensures that at least two
                adults have oversight of every boy’s individual progress and
                are there to support and encourage him.
