                We set regular Extra Work (homework) to be completed in the
                boarding House, with discrete time set aside for this. This
                encourages a culture of industry but also independence, as
                boys have to plan their free time to ensure it is completed.

                Regular internal reporting enables House Masters and Tutors
                to keep track of every boyâ€™s progress. Boys also sit
                internal examinations, known as Trials, in all their
                academic subjects at the end of the Michaelmas and Summer
                halves, unless they are taking external examinations.

                required, and boys can be referred to learning support at
