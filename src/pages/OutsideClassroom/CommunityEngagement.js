                Examination results matter. We understand this, and
                encourage all our boys to aspire to academic excellence. Our
                record in enabling boys to achieve the qualifications they
                need to access the best universities across the globe speaks
                for itself.&nbsp;
              </p>

              <p>
                That said, we strongly believe that the journey is as
                important as the destination, and to send a boy to
                university without the best habits of independent learning
                and, critically, a love of learning is to send him woefully
                unprepared. It is crucial that boys enjoy their studies,
                thrive and have fun, rather than leave feeling burnt out and
                disengaged.

                  The school is highly successful in fulfilling its aim to
                  promote the best habits of independent thought and
                  learning in the pursuit of excellence. This is reflected
                  in exceptional results in GCSE, A-level and Pre-U

                Our academic curriculum is broad. With 28 subjects on offer,
                including 10 modern and classical languages, every boy has
                the best opportunity to discover his passion.&nbsp;
              </p>

              <p>
                Our Masters are subject-specialists who invariably hold
                prestigious degrees in their subjects, but equally as
                important in their appointment has been their capacity to
                build relationships and inspire learners.
              </p>

              <p>
                Our House Master and Tutor system ensures that at least two
                adults have oversight of every boy’s individual progress and
                are there to support and encourage him.

                We set regular Extra Work (homework) to be completed in the
                boarding House, with discrete time set aside for this. This
                encourages a culture of industry but also independence, as
                boys have to plan their free time to ensure it is completed.

                Regular internal reporting enables House Masters and Tutors
                to keep track of every boy’s progress. Boys also sit
                internal examinations, known as Trials, in all their
                academic subjects at the end of the Michaelmas and Summer
                halves, unless they are taking external examinations.

                any time during their GHS career.
