                At GHS Karachi, we understand that a successful education goes hand in hand with emotional well-being. Thatâ€™s why pastoral care is a fundamental part of school life, ensuring every student feels valued, supported, and heard.
                </p>
                <p style={{ fontFamily: "Nunito Sans" }}>
                  Our approach to pastoral care includes one-on-one mentorship
                  programs, group workshops, and open-door policies that
                  encourage students to reach out whenever they need guidance.
                  Dedicated staff members work to create a nurturing environment
                  where students can confidently navigate challenges, celebrate
                  their achievements, and build emotional resilience.
                </p>

                  <p style={{ fontFamily: "Nunito Sans" }}>
                    Through a focus on empathy, kindness, and mutual respect, we
                    aim to foster a community where every student feels secure
                    and empowered to be their best self.
