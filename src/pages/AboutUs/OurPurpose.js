                            a) is committed to establishing a supportive and
                            safe environment for its boys, its staff and the
                            wider school community; this is the foundation
                            of the trusting relationships formed between
                            boys and adults, which is a particular feature
                            of GHS life.

                          <p>
                            b) has a competitive school culture in which
                            boys are encouraged to pursue excellence in all
                            its differing forms, to develop their strengths
                            and to seek out new challenges. This often helps
                            to drive personal and collective achievement,
                            with the process being valued as much as the
                            outcome.

                            c) is more devolved and less centralised than
                            many institutions. This deliberately gives
                            greater autonomy to adults and to boys, who
                            accept that with that autonomy comes
                            responsibility and accountability. Rigorous
                            planning and attention to detail are central to
                            the schoolâ€™s sustained success.

                            honours many of its traditions; but the school
                            has always had a dynamic relationship with its
                            past and it is in balancing the old with the new
                            that it finds inspiration for change in the
                            future.
