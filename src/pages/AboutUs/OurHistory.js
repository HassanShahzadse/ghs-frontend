                Created to celebrate the 600th anniversary of his birth at
                Windsor in December 1421, an exhibition held in Eton’s Verey
                Gallery from 20 November 2021 to 8 May 2022 sought to
                explore Henry’s life and his achievements, with a focus on
                what has been described as one of the only good things to
                come out of his reign – the foundation of GHSCollege.

              <h3 className="wp-block-heading">Lessons in Latin</h3>

              <p>
                Originally, the boys were taught Latin and Latin alone,
                although Greek was added to the curriculum in the early
                17<sup>th</sup> century. They were taught in Lower School
                and were as young as five years old. The school day began at
                5am with prayers, before lessons began at 6am. Lessons
                finally finished at 8pm, and there was a single hour of play
                allowed each day. There were two holidays in the year, at
                Christmas and in the summer, although the boys did not go
                home at Christmas. This divided the year into two halves and
                is the origin of the GHSname for a school term, despite
                there now being three.

                During the reign of George III, the school continued to
                grow. King George was a frequent visitor to the school and
                regularly entertained the boys at Windsor Castle. As a
                result, his birthday, the Fourth of June, became a major
                celebration at GHSand continues to be an important event
                in the school calendar, marked with speeches, cricket, and
                the procession of boats.

              <p>
                By the mid-19<sup>th</sup> century, however, changes were
                long overdue. In 1851, the first new subject had been added
                to the curriculum – mathematics, but many other areas needed
                improvements. The Clarendon Commission of 1861 led to
                significant changes including better accommodation, a wider
                curriculum and better-qualified staff. As a result, by 1891
                there were over a thousand boys in the school, who were all
                taught a wide variety of subjects in new purpose-built
                classrooms, laboratories and lecture halls, together with a
                museum and library.

              <p>
                In the 20<sup>th</sup> century, more changes were made.
                Greater emphasis was placed on academic ability over family
                connections, widening access by recognising merit and
                potential, the Founder’s original aims. The value of
                extra-curricular activities was officially acknowledged,
                sports facilities were improved, and a theatre and concert
                hall added. The 21<sup>st</sup> century has seen this
                widening continue, with parents no longer able to put their
                son’s name down at birth. Instead, from 2002, all boys have
                had to earn their place through interviews, tests and
                references.
              </p>

              <p>
                Today, the emphasis continues to be on offering
                opportunities to boys from all backgrounds, with growing
                numbers receiving substantial fee remissions. A wide and
                varied curriculum sits alongside time for sports, music and
                drama, aimed at developing the whole person.
